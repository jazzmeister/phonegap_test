You should note that for content that is periodically updated, the last updated date will be stated and you should check this date. We do not warrant that any changes will be made on any frequency including for important changes in evidence or drug information or otherwise.</p>
	    
	    <h2>Additional Product Specific Disclaimers</h2>
	    
	    <h3>Best Health</h3>
	    
	    <p>Best Health is designed for non-medically trained individuals. It does not offer medical advice and should not be seen as a replacement for consultation with a doctor or other health professional. The articles and information on the Best Health website are designed for you to help you talk to your doctor, not to be used instead of seeing your doctor.</p>
	    
	    <p>Categories presented in Best Health indicate a judgement about the strength of evidence and the relevant importance of benefits and risks. We rely on our authors to confirm accuracy.</p>
	    
	    <p>Readers should be aware that professionals in the field may have different opinions. Also there are regular advances in medical research. Our categories do not indicate whether a particular treatment is generally appropriate or whether it is suitable for an individual.</p>
		    
	    <p>Best Practice, Best Practice DX, Evidence Summary Pages and Action Sets & Drug Databases linked to from within</p>
	    
	    <p>Best Practice (including DX), the Evidence Summary Pages and Action Sets are intended for use by licensed medical health professionals. You are responsible for your decisions on diagnosis, treatment and follow up for a patient, or from choosing or not choosing specific treatments based on this. The content does not, provide any conclusive checklists, endorse drugs, diagnose patients, or recommend therapy. Users should use their professional judgment in using the BMJ Group or licensed in content, which is done at their own risk. They should always check and ensure that in each situation at the point of care they are qualified to consult and/or treat and/or prescribe at the point of care of a patient. Categories presented indicate a judgment about the evidence and strength of evidence available to our authors and licensors prior to publication and the relevant importance of benefit and harms. BMJ Group relies on its authors to confirm the accuracy of the information presented to prescribe generally accepted practices.</p>
			
	    <p>Users should be aware that professionals in the field may have different opinions. Because of this fact and because of regular advances in medical research and the possibility of human error, users should independently verify specified diagnosis methods, evidence, treatments, follow up, drugs and any contraindications or side effects including via manufacturers guidance. Also, the categories and information do not indicate whether a particular diagnosis, evidence, treatment andor drug or other follow up is generally appropriate or whether it is up to date and suitable for a particular individual. The Content is no substitute for individual patient assessment based upon the healthcare provider's examination of each patient and consideration of laboratory data and other factors unique to the patient. Please also note that information whilst not warranted to be accurate, is generally updated annually, so may be out of date and you should check the last updated date for any section being used. Ultimately it is the User's responsibility to make your own professional judgments, so to appropriately advise and treat yourself or your patients</p>
	    
	    
	    <h3>BMJ Updates</h3>
	    

	    <p>The information contained in BMJ Updates is intended for medical professionals. BMJ Updates provides an educational service for practising clinicians, designed to alert clinicians to important new research; however we cannot warrant its accuracy. It is intended to support evidence based decision making, by providing links to published research reports about the diagnosis, treatment, preduction and prognosis, etiology and economics of medical conditions. However, "evidence does not make decisions". Clinicians making decisions about the care of their patients must take into account the limitations of evidence from research as well as the unique nature of their patients' circumstances and wishes. Readers should also be aware that professionals in the field may have different opinions. Because of this fact and also because of regular advances in medical research, we strongly recommend that readers independently verify any information they chose to rely on. Ultimately it is the reader's responsibility to make their own professional judgements.
	    BMJ Updates attempts to provide access to the best new research of relevance for clinical practice in the fields of primary medical care and sub specialties of internal medicine. It does not report all research but uses explicit criteria (<a onclick="appLib.openLink('http://tiny.cc/purpose_and_procedure');">tiny.cc/purpose_and_procedure</a>) to define a subset of published research that is likely to be valid and ready for clinical attention. Practising physicians then provide their assessments of the relevance and newsworthiness of the reports through an online review process, the McMaster Online Rating of Evidence (MORE, <a onclick="appLib.openLink('http://hiru.mcmaster.ca/MORE');">http://hiru.mcmaster.ca/MORE</a>). Individual clinicians who then receive these reviews must then apply their own judgement concerning the strength and applicability of this evidence to their own patients.</p>
	    
	    <h3>BMJ, Student BMJ, BMJ Journals (including BMJ Case Reports), BMJ Careers, Veterinary Record & Vet Record Careers</h3>
	    
	    <p>We rely on our authors of articles, contractors and third party data providers to confirm the accuracy of information and advertisements presented and to describe generally accepted practices and therefore we as the publisher and editors cannot warrant its accuracy. Differences may occur also between the print and online text of articles and advertisements. Readers should be aware that professionals in the field may have different opinions. Because of this fact and also because of regular advances in medical research we strongly recommend that readers independently verify any information that they chose to rely upon. Ultimately it is the reader's responsibility to make their own professional judgements.</p>
	    
	    <h3>BMJ Learning</h3>
	    
	    <p>We do not warrant that the completion of any Modules or use of other BMJ will be all the necessary continuing professional development you need nor that it is accurate. We rely on our authors of articles, contractors and third party data providers to confirm the accuracy of information presented and to describe generally accepted practices and therefore we as the publisher and editors cannot warrant its accuracy or that this meets all or any requirements for professional development. Readers should be aware that professionals in the field may have different opinions. Because of this fact and also because of regular advances in medical research we strongly recommend that readers independently verify any information that they chose to rely upon.

	    <h3>Clinical Evidence</h3>
	    
	    <p>The information contained in this publication is intended for medical professionals. Categories presented in Clinical Evidence indicate a judgement about the strength of the evidence available to our authors prior to publication and the relevant importance of benefit and harms. We rely on our authors to confirm the accuracy of the information presented to describe generally accepted practices.
